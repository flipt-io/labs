Scroll down to the 'Variants' section and notice that we've pre-populated three variants:

- `default`
- `sarcastic`
- `liar`

These variants are the values that we will use to determine which sentiment our chatbot has when communication with our users.

Next, click on the 'Evaluation' tab to see the rule that we've pre-populated.

This rule will be used to determine which variant to use for a given user.

Notice that there is about a 33% chance for each variant to be selected.

The `entityID` of the evaluation request is used to determine which variant is returned. This is used to ensure that the same user always gets the same variant.

More on this in the next step.
