# Installing the Client SDK

In this repository, there is a folder named `frontend` which holds all the TypeScript code for this tutorial.

This is where we'll integrate with Flipt to hide and show the new chatbot panel.

We've already added some calls here using the [flipt-node](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-node) SDK which will interact with a running instance of the Flipt server. More on this on the next page.

The Flipt Node Client provides a wrapper in TypeScript around the fetch API. It hides some of the implementation details needed when communicating with Flipt over HTTP.

If you want to install the client in your own project, you can do so by running:

`npm install @flipt-io/flipt`.
