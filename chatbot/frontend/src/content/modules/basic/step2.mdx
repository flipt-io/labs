# Guarding the Chat

In the file, `App.tsx` inside the `frontend/src` folder, you will find the following code:

```tsx
const [chatEnabled, setChatEnabled] = useState(false);

const client = new FliptApiClient({
  environment: "http://localhost:8080",
});

const checkChatEnabled = async () => {
  try {
    const flag = await client.flags.get("default", "chat-enabled");
    setChatEnabled(flag.enabled);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
  }
};
```

Here we're doing the following:

1. Creating a new instance of the `FliptApiClient`
2. Using the `useEffect` hook to fetch the flag value from the server when the component is mounted
3. Storing the flag value in the `chatEnabled` state variable

Now, we can use the `chatEnabled` variable to conditionally render the chat component:

```tsx
{
  chatEnabled && (
    <ChatWindow>
      <Chat />
    </ChatWindow>
  );
}
```

You'll notice that even though the chat component exists in code, it's not visible. This is because the flag doesn't currently exist in Flipt yet.

Let's create it.
