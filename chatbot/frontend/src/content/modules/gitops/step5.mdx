# Test It Out

Once again we can experiment with the chatbot and alter the different persona's.

1. Use the component below to input a username. Then click 'Set'.

   The username you enter will be used to mimic a user interacting with our bot and determine the sentiment of the message.

   <Well>
     <InteractiveArrow subheading="Set a username to mimic a specific user interacting with our bot" />
     <User />
   </Well>

2. Ask the chat bot a new question
3. Try changing the username and asking the same question again

Flipt is serving the changes you approved and merged directly from the Git repository.

After experimenting with different usernames, click 'Next' to try out editing feature flag state yourself.
