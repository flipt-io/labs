# Test It Out

Now that our distribution is set to 100% for `sarcastic` it shouldn't matter what name you choose.
The chatbot should always return the same sarcastic responses.

1. Use the component below to input a username. Then click 'Set'.

   <Well>
     <InteractiveArrow subheading="Set a username to mimic a specific user interacting with our bot" />
     <User />
   </Well>

2. Ask the chat bot a new question
3. Try changing the username and asking the same question again

After experimenting with different usernames, click 'Next' to wrap up the tutorial.
