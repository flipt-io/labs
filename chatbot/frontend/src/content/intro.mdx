# Chatbot Tutorials

![Flipt Chatbot](/images/chatbot.png)

This application is designed to be a set of interactive tutorials on how to use [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io).

It's intended to be both a learning tool and a reference implementation for how to use Flipt in a real application.

In particular, this application demonstrates how to use Flipt to:

- Use a simple feature flag to control the availability of the chatbot.
- Use segmentation to determine which sentiment or persona the chatbot should use based on the user's username.
- Use Git as a source of truth and leveraging GitOps for feature flag data showing how to use Flipt without a UI.

The chatbot is designed to answer questions about Flipt. If you enable OpenAI support, by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, you will get much better answers as the chatbot will use the OpenAI API to generate answers that are based on our live documentation ([https://flipt.io/docs](https://flipt.io/docs))

If you don't have an OpenAI API key, you can still use the chatbot, but the answers will be much more limited as they're based on a static set of answers that are included in the application.
