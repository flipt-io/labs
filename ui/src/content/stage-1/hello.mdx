# Hello, World

Let's imagine you are a developer working on adding a chatbot UI to your user facing documentation. The chatbot UI will be able to answer questions about your product and documentation. Since the chatbot is still in active development, you want to first test it out with a small subset of users before rolling it out to everyone to ensure that it works as expected.

In order to do this, we'll use [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io). Flipt is an open source, feature flagging application meant to run within your infrastructure and integrate with tools and applications that you likely already have in your stack.

In this example, we'll use feature flags to toggle the chatbot UI on and off for different environments (e.g. staging vs production). After that, we'll demonstrate how to use evaluation to enable rendering the chatbot UI for different users depending on their role.
