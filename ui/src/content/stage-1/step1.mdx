# Installing the Client SDK

In this repository, there is a folder named `ui` which holds all the Typescript code for the general UI. In order to check flag state from the client code, we'll need to make a few HTTP requests against a running Flipt server.

Fortunately, to avoid the burden you with the boilerplate networking code, we have integrated one of our official clients, the Flipt [Node Client](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-node) into the UI code. This client will make requests to the Flipt server and update the UI based on the flag state.

In the future, if you wanted to install the client in your own project, you can do so by running `npm install @flipt-io/flipt`.
