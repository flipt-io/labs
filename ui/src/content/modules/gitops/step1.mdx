# Getting started with Gitea

This tutorial uses a project called [Gitea](https://about.gitea.com/), which is an self-hosted alternative to GitHub. This is where our source of truth git repository will live.

We're going to review and merge some pull-requests with changes to our Flipt state configured as yaml files.

## Setup

<Well>
**Required:** Run the following command in a terminal from the root of this repository to start all of the services required for this tutorial:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.gitops.yml up
```

</Well>

Before we continue with the tutorial, we're going to login to Gitea using the following credentials:

```
username: flipt
password: password
```

When the services have all started successfully, you will be able to login to Gitea at [http://localhost:3001/user/login](http://localhost:3001/user/login?redirect_to=%2fflipt%2ffeatures).
