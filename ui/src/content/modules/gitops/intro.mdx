# GitOps

The goal of GitOps is to make Git the source of truth for your entire systems configuration.
Flipt's Git type filesystem-backend provides a simple to operate GitOps workflow for Flipt.

For this tutorial we're going to explore running Flipt with a Git repository as its source of truth.

We're going to re-explore the same problems outlined in the [Basic](/basic) and [Advanced](/advanced) tutorials,
so it's recommended to checkout those before continuing.

This time we're going to update Flipt by merging pull-requests with the changes to Flipt state instead of clicking around the UI.
