# Editing Flag State With Git

It is one thing to review a flag state change and another to make the change yourself using `git` and your editor.
So we're going to do just that.

First, you're going to clone the features repository locally into a folder called `features`:

1. From the root of the chatbot example repository do the following:

```sh
git clone http://flipt:password@localhost:3001/flipt/features.git \
  features

cd features
```

Now you're in the `flipt/features` repository you can edit the `features.yml` file manually.

2. Using an editor of your choice, open `features.yml`.
3. Once open, change the distribution of the `sarcastic` variant to 100 percent.

```yaml
- key: chat-personas
  name: chat-personas
  description: Allow our chat bot to have different personalities
  enabled: true
  variants:
  - key: default
  - key: sarcastic
  - key: liar
  rules:
  - segment: beta
    rank: 1
    distributions:
    - variant: default
      rollout: 0
    - variant: liar
      rollout: 0
    - variant: sarcastic
      rollout: 100.0
segments:
- key: beta
  name: Beta
  description: Beta users who will test our chatbot personas
  match_type: ALL_MATCH_TYPE
```

4. Finally, add, commit and push this as a commit directly onto the `main` branch.

```sh
git add features.yml

git commit -m 'feat: rollout sarcastic variant to all users'

git push origin main
```

Congratulations, now everyone gets to enjoy our sarcastic chatbot! ðŸŽ‰
