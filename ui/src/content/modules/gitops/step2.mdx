# Enabling the chat-bot

In the [Basic](/basic) tutorial we defined the feature flag `chat-enabled`.

Currently, our git repository contains a definition for this flag, however, it is in a `disabled` state:

Luckily, one of our helpful colleagues has prepared a pull-request which enables this flag!
