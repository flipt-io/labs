# Hello, World

Let's imagine you are a developer working on adding a chatbot UI to your user facing documentation.

The chatbot will be able to answer questions about your product and documentation. Since the chatbot is still in active development, you'll want to be able to quickly turn it off should something go awry in production.

In order to do this, we'll use [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io). Flipt is an open source, feature flagging application meant to run within your infrastructure and integrate with tools and applications that you likely already have in your stack.

In this tutorial, we'll use feature flags to toggle the chatbot UI on and off without requiring a new code deployment.

## What You'll Learn

This module will show you how to:

- Install the Flipt Node SDK
- Guard a new feature with a Flipt flag in code
- Create a new feature flag in Flipt
- Enable a feature flag globaly for all users

## Structure

This repository is broken down into a few modules to help you get started learning Flipt:

1. [Basics](/) - (This module) Learn the basics of Flipt and how to use it to toggle the chatbot UI on and off.
2. [Advanced](/advanced) - Learn how to use Flipt to experiment with different chatbot sentiments.
3. [GitOps](/gitops) - Learn how to use GitOps to manage your feature flags without clicking around in the UI at all.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this module, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
