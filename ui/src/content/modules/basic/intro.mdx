# Hello, World

Let's imagine you are a developer working on adding a chatbot UI to your user facing documentation.

The chatbot will be able to answer questions about your product and documentation. Since the chatbot is still in active development, you'll want to be able to quickly turn it off should something go awry in production.

In order to do this, we'll use [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io). Flipt is an open source, feature flagging application meant to run within your infrastructure and integrate with tools and applications that you likely already have in your stack.

In this tutorial, we'll use feature flags to toggle the chatbot UI on and off without requiring a new code deployment.

## What You'll Learn

This module will show you how to:

- Install the Flipt Node SDK
- Guard a new feature with a Flipt flag in code
- Create a new feature flag in Flipt
- Enable a feature flag globaly for all users

Let's get started with the Basics!
