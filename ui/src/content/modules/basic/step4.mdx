# Enable the Flag

Now, back on the flag in Flipt that you just created:

![Update Flag](/images/basic/update-flag.png)

1. Click the 'Enabled' toggle
2. Click 'Update'

## Tada! ðŸŽ‰

If everything worked as expected, you should now see the chatbot in action **on this page**. Try to send a message to the bot and see what happens.

**Hint**: It really likes to talk about Flipt.

After chatting with the bot a bit, click 'Next' to wrap up the tutorial.
