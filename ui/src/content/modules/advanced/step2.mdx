# Segments And Constraints

Click the link [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to open the Flipt UI.

Click on the 'Segments' tab in the left navigation bar.

Segments are a way to group users together. You can create segments based on any user attribute. For example, you can create a segment for users who are in the 'beta' group.

In fact, this is exactly what we have done for this demo. We have created a segment called 'Beta'.

Click on the 'Beta' segment to view the details:

Scrolling down, you can see that the segment contains no constraints. [Constraints](https://www.flipt.io/docs/concepts#constraints) are used to check if a request matches a specific segment or not. By default a request will match a segment if there are no constraints.

Click 'Next' to continue.
