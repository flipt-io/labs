# Segments, Constraints, Rules Oh My!

Click the link [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) to open the Flipt UI.

Click on the 'Segments' tab in the left navigation bar.

Segments are a way to group users together. You can create segments based on any user attribute. For example, you can create a segment for users who are in the 'admin' group, or users who have a specific email domain.

In fact, this is exactly what we have done for this demo. We have created a segment called 'Admins' that contains users whose email address ends in `@internal.biz`.

Click on the 'Admins' segment to view the details:

Scrolling down, you can see that the segment contains a constraint that checks a property called `email` to determine if ends with `@internal.biz`.
