# Add Some Context

This module builds on the [Basic](/) module. If you haven't completed that module yet, please do so before continuing.

Now that we've learned the basics of Flipt, let's get a bit more advanced.

We're going to assume that the rollout of the chatbot UI has been successful and we're ready to enable it for all users. However, we also want to create an admin experience so that our team can shutdown the chatbot if it goes awry, as these ðŸ¤– sometimes tend to do!

We'll do this by creating a new feature flag called `chatbot-admin` to guard this admin experience so that only trusted users can access it.

## What You'll Learn

This module will show you how to:

- Create a new segment to represent our admin users
- Create a rule to evaluate whether a user is an admin
- Create a variant to represent the admin experience
- Return a variant based on the context of the user through evaluation

## Structure

This example is broken down into a couple of modules to help you get started learning Flipt:

1. [Basics](/) - Learn the basics of Flipt and how to use it to toggle the chatbot UI on and off.
2. [Advanced](/advanced) - (This module) Learn how to use Flipt to enable the chatbot admin UI for different users depending on their role.
3. [GitOps](/gitops) - Learn how to use GitOps to manage your feature flags without clicking around in the UI at all.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete these modules, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
