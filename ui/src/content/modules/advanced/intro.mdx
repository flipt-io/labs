# Experiment With Personas

This module builds on the [Basic](/basic) module. If you haven't completed that module yet, please do so before continuing.

Now that we've learned the basics of Flipt, let's get a bit more advanced.

We're going to assume that the rollout of the chatbot UI has been successful and we've ready to enable it for all users.

We now want to be able to test out different personas for the chatbot, but we want to limit this to only trusted users. We also want to make sure that the same user always gets the same sentiment of chat response.

We'll do this by creating a new feature flag called `chat-personas` to enable this experience. We'll also create variants for each persona and a rule to determine which user gets which one.

## What You'll Learn

This module will show you how to:

- Create a new segment to represent our test user base
- Create variants to represent the different chatbot personas
- Create a rule to evaluate which user gets which persona
- Return a variant based on the context of the user through evaluation

Let's get started with some more advanced Flipt concepts!
