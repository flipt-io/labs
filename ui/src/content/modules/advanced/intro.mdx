# Experiment With Personas

This module builds on the [Basic](/) module. If you haven't completed that module yet, please do so before continuing.

Now that we've learned the basics of Flipt, let's get a bit more advanced.

We're going to assume that the rollout of the chatbot UI has been successful and we've ready to enable it for all users.

We now want to be able to test out different personas for the chatbot, but we want to limit this to only trusted users. We also want to make sure that the same user always gets the same sentiment of chat response.

We'll do this by creating a new feature flag called `chat-sentiment` to enable this experience. We'll also create variants for each sentiment and a rule to determine which user gets which sentiment.

## What You'll Learn

This module will show you how to:

- Install the Flipt Python SDK
- Create a new segment to represent our this test user base
- Create variants to represent the different chatbot sentiments
- Create a rule to evaluate which user gets which sentiment
- Return a variant based on the context of the user through evaluation

## Structure

This example is broken down into a couple of modules to help you get started learning Flipt:

1. [Basics](/) - Learn the basics of Flipt and how to use it to toggle the chatbot UI on and off.
2. [Advanced](/advanced) - (This module) Learn how to use Flipt to experiment with different chatbot sentiments.
3. [GitOps](/gitops) - Learn how to use GitOps to manage your feature flags without clicking around in the UI at all.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete these modules, you'll need the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v16 or higher)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
