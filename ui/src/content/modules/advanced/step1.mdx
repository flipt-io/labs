# Concept: Evaluation

In this tutorial, we will make use of a concept in Flipt called [Evaluation](https://www.flipt.io/docs/concepts#evaluation).

This will allow us to evaluate each request from our application and determine which persona or sentiment our chatbot should have.
Evaluation is a powerful concept in Flipt that allows you to create complex rules for your flags.

Because we want to keep this tutorial simple, we will only be creating a single rule.
We will also use some pre-populated data include the flag, [variants](https://www.flipt.io/docs/concepts#variants) and the [segment](https://www.flipt.io/docs/concepts#segments) in order to reduce the amount of clicking required in the Flipt UI.

Run the following command in a terminal from the root of this repository to start a new Flipt instance:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.advanced.yml up
```

Once initialized, the Flipt server will be running on port `8080`.
