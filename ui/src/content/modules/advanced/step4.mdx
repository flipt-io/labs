# Test it Out

Now it's time to put all these concepts together and test out our different chatbot personas.

Use the component below to input a username. Then click 'Set'.

The username you enter will be used to mimic a user interacting with our bot and determine the sentiment of the message.

<Well>
  <InteractiveArrow subheading="Set an username to mimic a specific user interacting with our bot" />
  <User />
</Well>
