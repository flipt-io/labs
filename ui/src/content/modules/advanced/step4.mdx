import UserEmail from "../../../components/UserEmail";

# Test it Out

Let's now test out the feature flag and rule we just created.

Use the component below to input a user email and select the domain from the drop down. Then click 'Set'.

If the user is in the `@internal.biz` domain, then admin functionality will be enabled. Otherwise, it will be disabled.

<UserEmail className="mt-6" />
