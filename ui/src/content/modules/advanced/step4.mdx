# Test It Out

Now it's time to put all these concepts together and test out our different chatbot personas.

1. Use the component below to input a username. Then click 'Set'.

   The username you enter will be used to mimic a user interacting with our bot and determine the sentiment of the message.

   <Well>
     <InteractiveArrow subheading="Set a username to mimic a specific user interacting with our bot" />
     <User />
   </Well>

2. Ask the chat bot a new question
3. Try changing the username and asking the same question again

## What Happened?

If everything worked correctly, you should have seen the sentiment of the chatbot responses change depending on the username you entered.

This is because we're passing the username to our backend API which is then including it as the `entityId` in it's request to the Flipt evaluation endpoint.

You can view this code in the `backend/main.py` file:

```python
flag_key = os.environ.get("FLIPT_FLAG_KEY") or "chat-personas"
...

user = data["user"]
...

eval_request = evaluationRequest(
    flagKey=flag_key, entityId=user, context={}
)

eval_resp = flipt_api.evaluate.evaluate(
    namespace_key="default", request=eval_request
)
```

Above, we make a request to Flipt using the [flipt-python](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt-python) SDK to evaluate the `chat-personas` flag with the `entityId` we've been passed.

Because of how we configured our rule, Flipt determines which variant to return (`sentiment`) based on the `entityId`.

Each variant also has an `attachment` property which is just a JSON encoded string (if provided) to give metadata for each variant.

```python
attachment = json.loads(eval_resp.attachment)
pre_prompt = attachment["prompt"]
```

In this case we utilized the `attachment` to store part of our prompt which is engineered to craft the sentiment of the AI model.

Flipt evaluations are also "sticky" based on the user in this example, meaning the same user will always experience the same chatbot persona!
